# Expression Evaluator for Rationals Using Trees

## Overview
This project, developed during my tenure as a student at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, is an expression evaluator for programs written in E++. Leveraging my understanding of data structures and algorithms, I implemented a parser-based expression evaluator using expression trees and symbol tables.

## Technical Details
- **Parser-Based Evaluation:** Implemented a parser to convert fully parenthesized arithmetic infix expressions into expression trees, facilitating efficient evaluation.
- **Expression Trees:** Utilized expression trees to represent the structure of mathematical expressions, enabling easy traversal and evaluation of complex expressions.
- **Symbol Table Management:** Employed a Binary Search Tree (BST) as a symbol table to store and retrieve variable values during expression evaluation, ensuring efficient variable resolution.
- **Unlimited Integer and Rational Operations:** Developed classes for unlimited integer and rational number operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, demonstrating proficiency in handling arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
- **Syntax and Semantics Adherence:** Ensured strict adherence to syntax and semantics rules for E++ programs, validating input expressions before evaluation.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented error detection mechanisms to handle edge cases and prevent runtime errors during expression evaluation.
- **Performance Optimization:** Employed efficient algorithms and data structures to optimize performance and minimize time complexity, ensuring fast and reliable evaluation of expressions.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Proficiency in C++ Programming:** Demonstrated expertise in C++ programming language, implementing complex algorithms and data structures.
- **Algorithmic Problem-Solving:** Applied algorithmic techniques to design and implement efficient solutions for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.
- **Understanding of Data Structures:** Utilized fundamental data structures such as trees and Binary Search Trees (BSTs) to manage and manipulate data effectively.
- **Attention to Detail:** Ensured accuracy and precision in implementing syntax and semantics rules, validating input expressions to maintain program correctness.
- **Collaborative Work:** Worked effectively as part of a team, collaborating with peers and seeking guidance from course instructors to overcome challenges and achieve project objectives.

## Academic Achievement
- **Completion of COL106 Course:** Successfully completed the COL106: Data Structures and Algorithms course at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi under the guidance of Professor Rahul Garg.
- **High Performance in Assignments:** Achieved excellence in assignments and projects, demonstrating strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
